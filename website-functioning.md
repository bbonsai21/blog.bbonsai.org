# How does my website function?

Simplicity was what I wanted the moment I put my hands on a domain.<br>
Here you find no weird web frameworks that do 300 operations under the hood:
the weirdest thing you might come across is a .js fetch script that loads .md files so that they're displayed to the user.<br>
I am not a web developer, nor I have any desire for better looks. The 'retro' style (particularly, [bbonsai.org](https://bbonsai.org)) is very
nice on its own, and it doesn't require anything else to look great.<br>
YES, sure, that 'retro' style has been forced via .css, it's not a 'raw' HTML page. But the concept is clear: no pointless bloated frameworks.

# Where do I host my pages?

Everything is being hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/dingleberry21), via Github pages. I have paid nothing to set this up
(well, nothing besides the 3 domains, bought from [porkbun](https://porkbun.com), but we're talking about a cost of 3 euros every month,
for the next 10 years - it's nothing).<br>

# What's my workflow?

For the website's management, I do the following:<br>
- to publish a blog post I just happen to type in my terminal `blog [post_name].md` and it opens up nano. When I'm done I modify `index.html`
from `blog/dingleberija.com`'s source directory to display the latest post and then I push modifications through git
with `blog-save [git_push_msg]`.
<br>
- to publish a piece of information in my archive, I first do `archive`, then nano opens up a markdown (.md) file and, after saving, I do 
`archive-save` and it's committed and pushed to git.

# Who is Dingleberry/BlueBonsai?
Check [me](https://dingleberija.com) out.
<br>

# Why is this the first blog post?
So that everyone can set up a nice webpage the way I did. <br>
This post is meant to be updated soon with even more details (e.g. the bash implementation of my terminal commands, a step by step guide and tips).
